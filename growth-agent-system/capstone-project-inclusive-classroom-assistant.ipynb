    "# Objectives\n",
    "Accessibility is the main goal of this project. Students who are deaf or have hearing loss frequently rely on manually written notes or interpreters, neither of which are always available or reliable. By automatically converting lecture audio to text, this tool fills that gap and transforms spoken content into an engaging, reusable learning tool. The classroom becomes more inclusive and self-paced when students can **search lecture material, ask questions**, as well as even **create quizzes** for self-testing after it has been transcribed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following sections show the step-by-step code implementation of these features. It starts with setting up the environment, installing required libraries and packages, as well as building each component under the key features such as transcription, indexing, retrieval, and quiz generation. Every function plays a specific role in achieving the overall objective. In doing this, the lecture content becomes more inclusive, searchable, and engaging for all users."

    "# Project Objective\n",
    "# The Inclusive Classroom Assistant is designed to help educators and learners interact with lecture content more effectively. The project integrates multiple Gen AI capabilities to:\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Transcribe audio lectures: Convert uploaded audio files into text using Gemini STT.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Index and search transcripts: Use embeddings and a vector database (Chroma) to semantically index the transcript.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Answer questions: Employ a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) chain to answer questions based solely on the transcript context.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Generate quizzes: Create multiple-choice quiz questions from the transcript using few-shot prompting and structured JSON output.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# How to Run It\n",
    "# Set Up Your Environment:\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Ensure you have your Kaggle Notebook environment configured.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Install any required dependencies (e.g., LangChain, Chroma, GoogleGenAI modules) via pip in your notebook cell:\n",
    "#\n",
    "# bash\n",
    "# Copy\n",
    "# !pip install langchain chromadb google-generative-ai\n",
    "# Set your necessary API keys (e.g., GOOGLE_API_KEY) in the Notebook’s environment variables.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Run Cells Sequentially:\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Start by running the ORAGANIZED code\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Finally, run the main notebook cell that integrates the Gradio interface. Follow the on-screen instructions to upload audio, transcribe it, index the transcript, ask questions, and generate quizzes.\n",

    "# Interacting with the Interface:\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Upload an audio file in the Transcription & Indexing tab to get a transcript.\n",

    "# Audio Transcription:\n",
    "# Use Gemini’s speech-to-text engine to convert audio lectures into text.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Transcript Indexing:\n",
    "# Break the transcript into chunks and store them in a vector database using embeddings.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Question Answering:\n",
    "# Apply a RAG chain that retrieves context and uses few-shot prompting to generate answers directly from the transcript.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Quiz Generation:\n",
    "# Generate multiple-choice quizzes with controlled JSON output and few-shot examples for consistency.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# User-Friendly Gradio Interface:\n",
    "# An interactive UI with custom retro styling, featuring neon and pixel fonts for a unique, gamified experience.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Gen AI Capabilities and Their Implementation\n",
    "# The project integrates several Gen AI capabilities, which are implemented as follows:\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Structured Output / JSON Mode / Controlled Generation\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Where: In the quiz-generation chain.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# How: The quiz prompt instructs the LLM to output valid JSON in a strict format (question, options, answer). A JSON parser (using JsonOutputParser) is then applied to convert the output for further processing.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Few-Shot Prompting\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Where: In the RAG chain’s main prompt and the quiz prompt.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# How: The main prompt includes few-shot examples (e.g., examples regarding Master Sito) to guide the model on how to answer questions based on transcript excerpts. The quiz prompt also incorporates examples to demonstrate the expected structure for quiz questions.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Audio Understanding\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Where: In the Gemini STT function (transcribe_audio_chunk).\n",
    "#\n",
    "# How: The code uploads an audio file to Gemini and retrieves a text transcription of the lecture.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Function Calling\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Where: Standard function calls are used to handle transcription, indexing, RAG chain setup, and quiz generation.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# How: Although not using dynamic LLM function calls, the code is structured modularly to call functions based on user interaction in the Gradio interface.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Grounding\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Where: In the RAG chain prompt.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# How: The prompt instructs the LLM to base its answers exclusively on the transcript context, disregarding minor transcription errors and ensuring the answer is grounded in the provided text.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Embeddings\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Where: During the creation of the vector database in create_vector_db.\n",
    "#\n",

    "#\n",
    "# Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Where: In the RAG chain setup (within setup_rag_chain).\n",
    "#\n",

    "#\n",
